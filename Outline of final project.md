# Outline of final project

## 1. assignment

野田 遼平					video edit and slide

栃本 拓海					modeling

YE ZHUOBIN			  coding

TSAI CHANCHANG	application designing, presentation and something else(help coding, etc.)

## 2. description of the application 

​	Our camera will capture desktop in the real world.

​	And we will place two markers on the table.

​	The application will capture two markers and render an archer on the one marker and render a box on the other marker.

​	At the begining, the archer will do nothing and just stand there. And we can move two marker to make them closer. When distance is smaller than a threshold, the archer start to shot the arrow to the box. 

​	Move the markers and change their angle, the archer will also rotate to face towards to the box.

​	(Advanced, if have any time) The box will not just appear on the marker statically, it will drop from the top (from the right above the marker). And we will have a third marker to control the archer. Shake the third marker to shot the dropping box. If the arrow hit the box, the arrow and the box will disappear and the score will plus one.
